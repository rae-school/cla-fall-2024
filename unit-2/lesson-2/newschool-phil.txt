Launch Experience 





























At Lang, the study of philosophy introduces you to the history of ideas, encompassing multifarious texts, thinkers, and ways of thinking. The guiding purpose of our interdisciplinary curriculum is to foster an interest in and love for exploring and criticizing the intellectual traditions that form the basis of understanding modern humanity. We are committed to serious philosophical analysis of the most pressing social, political, and cultural challenges of our time, with the hope of translating this knowledge into responsible action.







Study Options
Major, Minor









Our sense of self, what we consider important, how we pursue knowledge and life, even our tastes and inclinations are all issues that have long been studied in the field of philosophy. But as a dynamic practice that recognizes the importance of the lived world and experience, philosophy at Lang is also aimed at addressing the need, even the responsibility, to challenge and rethink what is traditionally accepted as true about who and what we are. A plurality of ideas demands a plurality of voices.Recognizing the problematic underrepresentation of BIPOC communities as well as women within academic philosophy, the Lang Philosophy program aims to remove barriers to inclusiveness. We have adopted a set of Community Agreements (PDF) to foster and facilitate open and constructive dialogue. With social justice as a guiding principle and in an effort to make space for new voices, the department has also launched the Philosophy Film Club and a First-Gen Discussion Group. We further support the following philosophy groups and workshops:Minorities and Philosophies (MAP) ChapterPeople in Support of Women in Philosophy (PSWIP) GroupMajor requirementsMinor requirementsConnecting to New York CityWhile it offers the atmosphere and intimacy of a small college, Eugene Lang College is part of The New School, a major progressive university in New York City. Within this cultural, intellectual, artistic, and political hub, philosophy students enrich their studies by immersing themselves in the city and its diverse communities. Using The New School and New York City as your laboratories, you'll gain knowledge, skills, and opportunities to address society's challenges.Career PathsGraduates of the Philosophy program have gone on to pursue careers in a wide variety of fields, both professional and academic, including law, consulting, politics, public service, writing, publishing, and the arts and sciences.Consult our 4-Year Lang Career Pathways Map (PDF) for helpful steps and resources to link your academic journey to your future plans. If you are planning to go on to graduate study in philosophy, consider applying to the Bachelor's-Master's program. This program enables you to earn graduate credits that will apply to both your Lang degree and a master's degree in Liberal Studies or in Philosophy at The New School for Social Research, where the Department of Philosophy faculty includes leading contemporary philosophers in the Continental tradition.Outcomes at Lang
